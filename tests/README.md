# 🔍 **Quality Check: Ensuring Data Reliability & Integrity**  

During the **ETL process**, we ensure that every column meets **specific parameters and standards** to create **well-structured, reliable, and insightful** tables for the next steps.  

We are using **Medallion Architecture (Bronze, Silver, and Gold layers)** to build this **modern data warehouse**. At each stage, **data quality checks** help us maintain:  
✅ **Reliability** – Ensuring accurate and consistent data.  
✅ **Efficiency** – Reducing errors and improving performance.  
✅ **Data Integration** – Providing clean and structured data for analytics.  

🚫 **No Quality Checks on the Bronze Layer!**  
- Since the **Bronze layer** stores **raw, unprocessed** data from source systems, we do **not** alter it.  
- Data validation and transformation occur in the **Silver & Gold layers**.
